## Accessibility Needs
We agreed that we openly share our info, progress, links including links to cloned repo and link to final version.

## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations
We decided to work in collaboration - we take time to investigate task and think about our ideas and implementation separatly and after it we will come together and discuss it. Main channel for us is Slack. Wave 1-2 until 09/30 - we will discuss it on Tuesday from 1 to 2pm. Wave 3 and 4 for Tatiana (Wednesday). Wave 5 and 6 for Alice (Wednesday). Thursday for debagging.

## Learning Style
We will take time to investigate the task and think about our ideas and implementation (pieces of code) separately, and afterwards we will come together to discuss them.

## Preferred Feedback Style
Small issues will be resolve via verbal communication. Big issues will be resolve via direct Slack message.

We prefer direct style of communication.

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
Understand someone's code.

## Optional: Other agreements
Let's have fun and try to enjoy the process.
